Go fish game 
This go fish game involves play against the computer.  Each player starts with 7 cards and takes turns asking eachother for cards.  The goal is to make sets (4 of a kind) and the game ends whenever someone runs out of cards or the end of the deck is reached.  The winner is the player that made the most sets.

To start the game simply run the command ./gofish.py on the command line while in the game directory.  (No compilation necessary) 

The game will prompt the user to ask for a card.  The user may simply type a card number in a standard deck (2-10, J, Q, K, A) and press enter to ask the computer for any given card in their hand.  The program will handle input in a case-insensative manner, so capitalization does not matter.
